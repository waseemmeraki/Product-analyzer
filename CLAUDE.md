# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Architecture Overview

This is a **Product Analysis Platform** built as a Next.js full-stack monorepo using Turbo for build orchestration. The application allows users to scrape product data from Ulta Beauty, analyze trends, and generate insights using AI.

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 app at `apps/web` (port 3001) - Product selection, analysis visualization, and PDF export
- **Backend**: Express.js API at `apps/api` (port 3002) - Scraping, analysis, and data management
- **Database**: MySQL with Sequelize ORM at `packages/database`
- **Shared Types**: TypeScript interfaces at `packages/types`
- **UI Components**: React components at `packages/ui` (Shadcn UI based)

## Key Development Commands

### Project Setup
```bash
npm install                           # Install all workspace dependencies
cp .env.example .env                 # Copy root environment variables
cp apps/web/.env.local.example apps/web/.env.local    # Frontend env
cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env               # Backend env
```

### Database Operations (Sequelize)
```bash
cd packages/database
npm run db:create                    # Create database
npm run db:migrate                   # Run migrations
npm run db:migrate:undo              # Undo last migration
npm run db:seed                      # Seed database
npm run migration:create -- --name migration-name  # Create new migration
npm run db:test                      # Test database connection
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
npm run dev                          # Start all services (frontend + backend)
cd apps/web && npm run dev          # Frontend only (port 3001)
cd apps/api && npm run dev          # Backend only (port 3002) 
```

### Building and Type Checking
```bash
npm run build                        # Build all apps
npm run type-check                   # Type check all packages
npm run lint                         # Lint all packages
```

## Database Schema Architecture

The application uses MySQL with Sequelize ORM. The main entity is:

- **Product**: Stores scraped product data from Ulta Beauty
  - `Id`: UUID primary key
  - `Name`: Product name
  - `Brand`: Product brand (currently "Ulta")
  - `Category`: Product category (e.g., "Shampoo", "Moisturizers")
  - `Ingredients`: Full ingredient list as text
  - `IngredientCategories`: AI-generated categories for ingredients
  - `Claims`: Product claims/benefits as text
  - `Rating`: Product rating (0-5)
  - `ReviewCount`: Number of reviews

The schema also includes migrations for Users, Projects, and Events (from template) but these are not currently used in the application.

## API Architecture

- Path aliases configured: `@/*` for src directories
- Strict TypeScript config across all packages

### Environment Variables
- Separate `.env` files for each app with examples provided
- Backend requires: 
  - `DATABASE_URL` (MySQL connection string)
